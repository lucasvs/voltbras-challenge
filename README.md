## Voltbras challenge
Challenge using the GraphQl to find planets using the [Arcsecond] API

### Running the application

The application is built with Node.js and already has all environment configured with docker. To start the application you will need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on the machine. Having that you may run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

And then the application and database will be started:

```shell
nginx-proxy-voltbras is up-to-date
voltbras-challenge_postgres_1 is up-to-date
voltbras-challenge_node_1 is up-to-date
voltbras-challenge_adminer_1 is up-to-date
```

The application will be available on [http://voltbras-challenge.localhost](http://voltbras-challenge.localhost) by default.

## Running the tests

To run the test locally on your machine, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose run node yarn test
```
